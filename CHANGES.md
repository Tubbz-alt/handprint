Change log for Handprint
========================

Version 1.1.0
--------------

* Improve installation instructions and avoid telling people to use `sudo`.
* Add facility to compare extracted text to a ground truth file. This is enabled using the command-line option `-c`. See the README file or help text for more details.
* Change the debug option `-@` to accept an argument for where to send the debug output trace. The behavior change of `-@` is not backward compatible.
* Internally, package metadata is now stored in `setup.cfg`.  Also, there is no `handprint/__version__.py` anymore, and instead, some special code in `handprint/__init__.py` extracts package-level variables directly from the installation created by `pip`.
* Most test images have been removed from `tests/images` and put instead in a more organized fashion in a separate repository, [htr-test-cases](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/htr-test-cases/).


Version 1.0.3
--------------

* Fix an internal bug getting the credentials file for Amazon services.


Version 1.0.2
--------------

* Fix [issue #9](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint/issues/9): credentials files are not saved in expected location.
* Edit the `README.md` file.


Version 1.0.1
--------------

This version adds instructions for installing from PyPI and fixes a bug writing files downloaded from URLs.


Version 1.0.0
--------------

This release provides a great many changes over the previous versions of Handprint.  The behavior and implementation have all changed in various ways, and collectively this marks the first version that can fairly be called version 1.0.0.

The following are some of the notable changes in this release:

* Credentials are now stored in a separate user directory; in additional, the process for installing credentials files is different, and involves invoking Handprint with the `-a` option.
* Handprint now calls services in parallel threads, to speed up processing.  The number of threads can be set via the `-t` option.
* To display the results of text recognition, Handprint now creates a summary image showing all service's results in an _N&nbsp;x&nbsp;N_ grid, thus allowing easy inspection and comparison of results across services.  By default, this is now the _only_ output that Handprint produces unless given the `-e` option.  With `-e`, Handprint also stores the raw data from the services and the pure text output.
* Images are now always sent to HTR services in PNG format, even when a service accepts other formats.  Source images will be converted to PNG if they are not already in that format.  (This simplifies processing and code flow.)
* Intermediate results files are now deleted unless the `-e` flag is given, reducing clutter and confusion.
* Some additional command-line arguments have been changed in backwards-incompatible ways.
* The [tests/images](tests/images) subdirectory has been reorganized, some previous images have been deleted, and some new ones have been added
* Internal code such as [network.py](handprint/network.py) has been updated to versions developed for other projects such as [Microarchiver](https://github/caltechlibrary/microarchiver).
* There are new command-line options.
* More bugs have been fixed in the code.
* More error checking has been added throughout.
* Much of the internal code has been refactored and rewritten.
* The repository now uses [READMINE](https://github.com/mhucka/readmine) structure for [README](README.md) file.
* Added code of conduct and contributor guidelines to the repository.


Version 0.9.0
-------------

* **Backward-incompatible change**: command-line option `-m` is now `-s` and "methods" are now known as "services", to avoid conflicting interpretations of what a "method" is in the context of software.  Internal object classes have likewise been changed.
* Refactor some internal network code.
* Add a number of additional images for testing.


Version 0.8.2
-------------

* Fix internal bug in file download code.
* Start separate file [CHANGES](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for the change log.


Version 0.8.1
-------------

* Detect and handle when the Google API returns a badly-formed bounding box.
* Skip files previously generated by the annotation feature of Handprint.


Version 0.8.0
-------------

Handprint now generates annotated images by default; they display the extracted text overlaid on the input images.


Version 0.7.5
-------------

Separate chunks of text in Microsoft output using newlines, rather than spaces, to make the results more comparable to what Google produces.


Version 0.7.4
-------------

This version improves efficiency by iterating over files/URLs first and then over methods, so that files do not get repeatedly downloaded each time a different method is used.  It also works around some network compatibility problems in different environments, and finally, adds a number of fixes.
