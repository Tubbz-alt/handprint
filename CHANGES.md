Change log for Handprint
========================

Version 1.0.0
--------------

This release provides many changes over the previous versions of Handprint.  The behavior and implementation have all changed in many large and small ways, and collectively this marks the first version that can fairly be called version 1.0.0.

The following are some of the notable changes in this release:

* Add support for Amazon's Rekognition and Textract services.
* Add new command-line options
* Create a summary image consisting of individual
* Use [READMINE](https://github.com/mhucka/readmine) structure for [README](README.md) file.
* Update some internal code such as [network.py](handprint/network.py) to versions developed for other projects such as [Microarchiver](https://github/caltechlibrary/microarchiver).
* Fix some small defects.
* Refactor some internal code.
* Add code of conduct and contributor guidelines.


Version 0.9.0
-------------

* **Backward-incompatible change**: command-line option `-m` is now `-s` and "methods" are now known as "services", to avoid conflicting interpretations of what a "method" is in the context of software.  Internal object classes have likewise been changed.
* Refactor some internal network code.
* Add a number of additional images for testing.


Version 0.8.2
-------------

* Fix internal bug in file download code.
* Start separate file [CHANGES](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint/blob/master/CHANGES.md) for the change log.


Version 0.8.1
-------------

* Detect and handle when the Google API returns a badly-formed bounding box.
* Skip files previously generated by the annotation feature of Handprint.


Version 0.8.0
-------------

Handprint now generates annotated images by default; they display the extracted text overlaid on the input images.


Version 0.7.5
-------------

Separate chunks of text in Microsoft output using newlines, rather than spaces, to make the results more comparable to what Google produces.


Version 0.7.4
-------------

This version improves efficiency by iterating over files/URLs first and then over methods, so that files do not get repeatedly downloaded each time a different method is used.  It also works around some network compatibility problems in different environments, and finally, adds a number of fixes.
